Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Hello on this fabulous day.

This webpage is a hodge-podge of things about me and what I like.

The first page you land on is the index:
:at the top, there are links to pages as listed
::github hyperlinks to my github
::resume hyperlinks to the resume page
::linkedin hyperlinks to my linked in
::contact me hyperlinks to a contact page
:below, my name is displayed
::hovering over the z hyperlinks to a video on youtube
:at the end of the page, there are recipes that I have drawn out
::each recipe hyperlinks to a different recipe page

The resume page:
:displays my resume
:hovering over resume will take you to an avatar page

The avatar page:
:the arrow hyperlinks to an IMBD page
:the table shows the fantasy "water-earth-fire-air" game from atla and who would win
:a list of the top 5 ranked episodes on IMBD

The contact me page:
:displays my contact information

The recipe pages:
:the pdf is shown
:a hyperlink to the video recipe with the bread icon

On all pages:
:if there is an x on the top right corner, it will take you back to the page you just came from
:there is possibly an easter egg which hyperlinks to another page
